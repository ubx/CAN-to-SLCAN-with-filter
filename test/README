This directory contains test scripts for validating the CAN-to-SLCAN bridge.
The primary focus of these tests is to verify throughput stability and ensure no message loss occurs during
high-load CAN traffic or long-running transfers.

Test Scripts:
- ACM-candump.py: Captures and validates SLCAN messages coming from the USB CDC-ACM (Serial) interface.
- BLE-candump.py: Monitors and decodes SLCAN traffic transmitted over the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface.
- BLE-hexdump.py: Provides a raw hexadecimal view of BLE notifications for low-level debugging of the wireless stream.
- CAN-candump.py: Directly interfaces with a native CAN bus to compare physical bus traffic against the bridged SLCAN output.
